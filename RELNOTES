  Dibbler 0.8.4 Release Candidate 1 release notes [2013-01-20]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is a Release Candidate 1 for 0.8.4 release of the Dibbler software.

 This is a release with several new features and many bug fixes.

 There is no single major new feature, just a lot of bug fixes.

 In particular, relay support has been rewritten. It is now possible to select
 subnet based on interface-id or value of linkaddr field set by the relay.
 Client classification has been improved and now can be used to differentiate
 between 2 or more classes, e.g. docsis3.0 and eRouter in cable networks.
 Confirm support has been cleaned. Daemon mode no longer has issues when reading
 from socket descriptor 0.

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.
