  Dibbler 0.8.3 release notes [2013-01-14]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is a final 0.8.3 release of the Dibbler software.

 This is a release with several new features and many bug fixes.

 The biggest feature is a rewritten address and prefix allocation engine. It
 follows the same algorithm now. It is possible to reserve specific address
 and/or prefix for a given host. The host can be referenced by DUID, remote-id
 or link-local address. Both in-pool and out-of-pool reservations are now
 supported.

 Support for DDNS is now significantly improved. Secure DNS Updates using TSIG
 are now supported. Many, many bugs were fixed and the FQDN handling code is now
 much more robust.

 The code now compiles on Solaris 11. It is not yet fully usable, and there are
 outstanding problems with link-layer address detection, but it is better than
 nothing.

 Script execution is now improved as well. It is called when receiving stateless
 configuration (after receiving reply to INF-REQUEST) and extra options (like
 FQDN and vendor-specific info) are now properly passed.

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.
