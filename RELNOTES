  Dibbler 1.0.1 Release Candidate 1 [2015-03-07]
 ------------------------------------------------

 This is the first Release Candidate of the 1.0.1 release of the Dibbler
 software.

 This update contains improvements specifically for OpenStack project.
 In particular, it is now possible to specify the client's link-local
 address and client's working directory. If you're running 1.0.0, there's
 no need to upgrade, unless you want to take advantage of those new features.
 See CHANGELOG for details.

 If you find bugs, please report them on http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/.
 Appropriate links are on project website: http://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/.
 If you need help or want to share your thoughts, take a look at one
 of two mailing lists: dibbler or dibbler-devel. Please do not contact
 author directly, unless you want to report security issues or discuss
 confidential matters.

 Thank you for using Dibbler.
