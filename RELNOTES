  Dibbler 1.0.0 [2014-11-07]
 ------------------------------------------------

 This is the 1.0.0 release of the Dibbler software.

 After over 11 years, Dibbler project finally reaches 1.0.0. This significant
 milestone was planned when all features described in RFC3315, a document
 that specifies DHCPv6, were implemented. It took radically more time
 then I initially thought. But here it is - a portable DHCPv6 implementation
 that features a server, a client, relay agent and a leasequery requestor.

 It works on a variety of Windows operating systems, starting from XP to 8,
 Linux, Mac OS, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. It may compile or even partially
 work on other systems.

 There is a handful of fixes since 1.0.0RC2 and one small feature: the
 server may be told to reject incoming unicast traffic with status code
 UseMulticast. According to my knowledge, this was the last missing feature.

 As you may have noticed, Dibbler development slowed down considerably
 in the last couple years. The reason is that I'm now involved in a new
 DHCP implementation, which takes more than 40 hours a week. It's simply
 a matter of work/life balance. I'm no longer able to dedicate significant
 amount of time for further Dibbler development.

 So is the project dead? No, I will still fix bugs occasionally. If
 there are patches that do not require significant rework, I may review and
 accept them. Even new features may appear occasionally, but they will
 be infrequent. My plan is to keep Dibbler alive long enough for Kea, the
 new project I'm involved in , to be a viable alternative. As of today, it
 has many of the server features, but still lacks client, relay and requestor
 components.

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.
