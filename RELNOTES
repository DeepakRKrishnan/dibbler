  Dibbler 0.8.4 [2013-06-27]
 ----------------------------

 This is a final 0.8.4 release of the Dibbler software.

 There is no single major new feature, just a lot of bug fixes:
 34 bug fixes, tweaks and small improvements since 0.8.3.

 Vendor class and User class methods are now implemented.

 Relay support has been rewritten. It is now possible to select subnet
 based on interface-id or value of linkaddr field set by the relay.
 Client classification has been improved and now can be used to
 differentiate between 2 or more classes, e.g. docsis3.0 and eRouter
 in cable networks.  Confirm support has been cleaned. Daemon mode no
 longer has issues when reading from socket descriptor 0.

 The database format has changed a bit. It now stores interface names,
 not just interface indexes. That is helpful in cases your interfaces
 has changed, e.g. when your ppp0 interface went down and was
 recreated with different ifindex. Opening up old database should be
 seamless, but make sure you make a backup before migrating to 0.8.4.

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.

  Planned changes in the next release
 -------------------------------------

 It is likely that the next release will be 0.9.0. It will offer the
 last major feature defined in RFC3315 that is still missing - full
 reconfigure support. Another planned update is a change how the
 addresses are configured by client. Right now it assumes /64, which
 is an arbitrary value (unless strict-rfc-no-routing is used). That
 will change and client will configure received addresses with /128 as
 envisaged by RFC3315.
